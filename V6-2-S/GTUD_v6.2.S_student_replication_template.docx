## Abstract

GTUD Digital Rotation v6.2.S is a student-friendly, one-day replication and falsification suite designed to reproduce and stress-test the quadratic Δθ² digital signature reported in the GTUD Digital Rotation v6.2 experimental validation package. The kit provides a single-command runner (Windows/macOS/Linux) that executes the v6.2 experiment and automatically generates a paper-ready output bundle (figures, CSV tables, manifest, hashes, and copy-paste Methods/Results). To keep results auditable and publishable, the suite implements a strict, transparent verdict rule: (i) reference-matching of the baseline condition against the v6.2 reference metrics, and (ii) multi-condition negative-control failure to prevent false positives and enable direct falsification. No specialized hardware is required; the workflow is intended for coursework, lab classes, replication notes, and rapid university verification. This release is split-licensed to support open academic use while restricting commercial exploitation: documentation and templates are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and code is PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
